Heya! 

My name is Nafaal and Iâ€™m currently undergoing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Bristol. I am currently very interested in understanding more about the cyber security field, although I am keen on learning anything computer science related.

Update, May 2023.
I am not keen on learning anything web dev. No.
