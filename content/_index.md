##  Hello

Heya!
I am a recent graduate from the University of Bristol with experience as a software developer specializing in backend development. More recently, I have redirected my interest from software development to the fields of networking and cybersecurity.   


This website is where I document my journey in the field of cybersecurity. It serves as a platform where I can share write-ups for capture the flag challenges and blog posts discussing subjects I learn along the way.
